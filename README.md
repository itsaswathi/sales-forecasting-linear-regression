# 📈 Sales Forecasting with Linear Regression

## 🧠 Problem Statement
Businesses struggle to estimate future sales based on past performance.

## 🎯 Objective
Build a regression model to predict future sales using historical data.

## 📁 Dataset
**File**: `sales_data.csv`  
Contains the following columns:
- `date`: Date of sale
- `product`: Product name
- `quantity`: Units sold

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Place `sales_data.csv` in your working directory.
2. Run the Python script:

```bash
python sales_forecasting.py
```

3. It will generate:
   - 📊 Forecast plot: `forecast_output.png`
   - 📄 Forecast table: `forecast_table.csv`

## 🎥 Optional Voice-over Script

> "Hi, I created a sales forecasting model using linear regression. First, I cleaned and aggregated sales data by date. Then, I trained a regression model to identify the sales trend. Finally, I used the model to predict revenue for the next 30 days, and visualized it in a plot and a table. This helps businesses get a basic idea of future performance using historical trends."
